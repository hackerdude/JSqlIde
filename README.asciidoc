JSQLIDE
=======

JSQLIDE is a very old piece of code. It is a query runner 
and SQL environment written in Java Swing.
It can run simple queries, request updatable resultsets for
you to edit values inline, can do some basic table editing,
and can keep remember queries you mark as useful.

I wrote it because at the time (1998?) there was really nothing
like it that could span multiple dbs and was open source.

Building and Running
--------------------

There's not much to it. To run, simply do

[source,bash]
--------------------------------------------------------
$ ant
$ java -jar build/jsqlide.jar
--------------------------------------------------------

a first-run dialog will help you tie in the JDBC jars to 
the configuration.
