Just some thoughts...

SQLIDE should become just a skeleton framework that allows people to write in
more functionality.

On the JBuilder OpenTools, the browser is a very important piece of the
framework. Likewise, on JSQLIDE...

	- BrowserPanel is important
	- CategoryNode and ItemNode are also important.

Plugins can be one of three forms:

	- Visual Plugins
	- Non-Visual Plugins
	- Node-based plugins.


All plugins must be registered in the plugin registry for them to load.

Common Functionality for plug-ins
=================================

All plugins will need a parameterless constructor and an initPlugin() method.
It is important to keep the constructor itself small so the plugins can be
instantiated just to find out their metadata (version information and so on).
The heavy initialization should occur on the initPlugin() method.


Visual Plugins
==============

Visual plugins descend from JPanel and are always associated with at least one
primary database connection.


Node Context Plugins
====================

Node Context Plugins are asked what action is available for a set of selected
nodes prior to showing a menu. The Node context is responsible for returning a
(possibly empty) set of standard swing actions.

Non-Visual Plugins
==================

Non-Visual plugins usually add a few menu items to the main menu structure. In
the future (once SQLIDE has streamlined its event model) they could also
register for events such as before open, before save, etc.
