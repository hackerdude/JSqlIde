<title>JSLIDE Plugin API Package</title></head>

<body bgcolor="white">This package contains the plugin API for JSQLIDE.

<P>The JSLQIDE Plugin API allows you to add your own functionality to the 
SQLIDE application. All the functionality of the plugin API is written 
using this API and the standard java packages.

<H2>JSQLIDE Design Basics</H2>

<P>The design of jsqlide is centered around the context of a browser interface, 
where on the left you can find browser nodes and on the right the editors for 
those nodes. Depending on the type of node and the editor that is active on 
the right-hand side, the actions you can effect on the node (which appear when
you right-click on the node itself) can change.

<H2>Implementing your own plugins</H2>

<P>There are several ways you can extend SQLIDE by implementing your own 
plugins:
</P>

<UL>
  <LI><B>Extend the Browser:</B> You can add your own browser nodes, which 
  can in turn expand to reveal other nodes. For this you can use the 
  BrowserExtensionPluginIF interface.</LI>

  <LI><B>Implement your own editor for the right-hand pane</B>. These are 
called "Visual plugins" in the context of SQLIDE. You can either implement 
IDEVisualPluginIF directly or extend AbstractVisualPluginIF.</LI>

  <LI><B>Create a set of actions for when a person right-clicks on a specific node</B>. 
  You add actions that can be different depending on the type of node. For this 
  you need to implement the IDENodeContextPluginIF interface.</LI>

  <LI><B>Something completely different</B>. If you just want a separate plugin 
  that happens to run along SQLIDE (like a daemon that monitors connections or 
  something that displays its own separate window), you can implement 
  IDENonVisualPluginIF which can be started and run semi-independently 
  from the application.</LI>

</UL>


<H2>Plugin Implementation Checklist</H2>

<OL>
  <LI>Create your plugin class</LI>
  <LI>Add your plugin to the registry on com/hackerdude/apps/sqlide/plugins.registry.properties</LI>
  <LI>If you want a plugin to start as SQLIDE itself starts, add it to com/hackerdude/apps/sqlide/autoexec.plugins.properties.
  typically you want to do this for Node Context, Node Extension and Nonvisual plugins. Don't do this for visual plugins, it won't work :-)</LI>
  <LI>Start coding!</LI>
