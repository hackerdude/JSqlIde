<title>The SQLIDE Browser</title></head>

<body bgcolor="white">The SQLIDE browser appears at the left of the application and allows you to 
browse your sql environment.

<P>The browser is a special type of plugin that is placed on the left-hand side
and can be extended by node extension plugins. Initially, it simply reads the
connection information and places child nodes for each connection.
