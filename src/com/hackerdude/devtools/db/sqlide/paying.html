<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Paying for it? But I thought it was free!</H1>

<P>Don't worry, <B>SQLIDE</B> <I>is and will remain</I> free. I don't expect to become rich
out of it and I only need the money as much as any other middle-class Joe.

<P>But I've been working on this a
long time, and I keep seeing ads for commercial programs similar in scope to
mine (SQL environments) that cost hundreds of dollars, many of which do only
slightly more than this one does, so I decided to start accepting donations.

<P>Don't get me wrong, some of these programs do a substantial amount more
than mine does, and those are worth every penny. But many other SQL
environments that don't do all that much still want to charge an arm and a leg
for. Frankly, it's a rip-off.

<P>Also a lot of companies like to know they paid for something, especially
when they're big and don't understand someone would write something and give it
away out of the good of their heart, or that something you are not required
to pay for can actually be quality work. These companies are usually run by
people who are just not very creative and so they're not in touch with
that kind of thing. :-)

<P>So now you can donate something. Your donation to the SQLIDE project will
go to help me buy better hardware (programming is my only hobby), which will
help the project in turn by helping me code faster and come up with nicer
and better features for SQLIDE. No, your donations are not tax deductible.

<P>So if you like this project and would like to see it succeed and become a
staple of every developer desktop like many Open Source projects already have,
please consider donating to it.
<P>A recommended donation for people living and working in the United States is
<FONT COLOR="FF0000"><B>$30 USD</B></FONT>
for each person that uses it - or
<FONT COLOR="FF0000"><B>$15 USD</B></FONT>
if you don't use it all that much
(hey, not a bad deal, a SQL environment for about what you'd pay for dinner).
But given the different economic conditions
of different countries (and the different budgets of each Engineering
department and each person), I'll let you decide what to give. It could be substantially
less, or substantially more. And I'd be just as happy with a postcard
from your city so I can see how far it's spread!

<P>Please send payments to:

<PRE>
	SQLIDE Project
	P.O. Box (To be determined)
	Antioch, CA (to be determined)
	United States
</PRE>

<P>And thank you for supporting free software, either by using it or by
donating to it!</P>
