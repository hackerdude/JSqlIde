<H2>Changes in SQLIDE</H2>

<H4>0.0.21:</H4>

<UL>
<LI>After a long hiatus decided to start work on this again.</LI>
<LI>A lot of refactoring was done. </LI>
<LI>Now SQLIDE allows you to specify the JAR files for the JDBC drivers on the fly.</LI>
<LI>A Java Web Start application can be created out of the code.</LI>
</UL>

<H4>0.0.17:</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>Now it works with Interclient JDBC Driver. There are several issues
	around the JAR - the version I have was compiled for JDK 1.3
	(so there is no java.lang.VerifyError), but it's an older version that
	locks up when getMetadata().getTables() is called with a null data type
	array. There were several small changes for it to actually work under
	InterClient, including the addition of extra checking on
	getCatalogs()/getSchemas() (which throw an exception instead of returning
	an empty resultset), and a checkbox to select whether the incoming query
	is an update so you can call resultSet.executeUpdate instead of
	resultSet.executeQuery (somehow InterClient "knows" if a query is going to be
	an  update and complains if you are expecting a resultset)</LI>

</UL>

<H4>0.0.16:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Got ambitious. Big revamping of SLQIDE's plugin interface. intf package
	has been deprecated. iSQL and Table Editor moved to the new interface.
	Highlights of the new interface include:
	<UL>
		<LI>Visual Plugin
		<LI>Non-Visual plugin
		<LI>Browser Extension plugin
		<LI>Node Context Plugin
	</UL>
	<LI>Added a factory for typical dialogs. Moved generation of
	SQLPreviewFileChooser there.
	<LI>Filechooser with SQL preview.
	<LI>Indices now read correctly.
</UL>

<H4>0.0.15:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Some source files moved to new packages for dataaccess and components.
	<LI>Added Column Model to JTables and column width calculations in pixels based on the SQL field size. Now the column minimum, current, and maximum widths are always sensible, which makes the display look professional.
	<LI>Added support for JDBC 2.0's Scrollable resultsets by creating a cached table model and a scrollable table model.
	<LI>Added Sybase server type to the ServerTypes package. Now the wizard can also do Sybase.</LI>
	<LI>Changed the format of the database specs to be more sensible. Eliminated the URL tokens idea.
	<LI>Added some more useful SELECTs to the context menu for columns.
	<LI>Changed the logging so it shows the class name. Useful for debugging.
</UL>

<H4>0.0.14:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Fixed problem preventing it from working with Sybase.
	<LI>Added select count, min, max to the context menu of the columns.
</UL>

<H4>0.0.11:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI>Fixed small problem with Oracle Schemas.

	<LI>Added new About dialog.

	<LI>Revamped browser information label so it shows multiple line code and a little (i) Icon.

	<LI>Added keystroke/action associations.

	<LI>Weird bug on the TableRenderer where icons would change when closing/expanding the parents on a tree has been fixed.

</UL>
	<LI>After moving allt he nodes, I noticed that whenever you selected a panel, they always come up bound to the Default ServerSpec. That doesn't make it very useful to have several serverspecs in the tree... :-) Fixed.

<LI>When you select a type, the combobox selection that appears always defaults to the first type instead of auto-selecting the type in the table column.

	<LI>The Interactive SQL window has undergone a redesign based on the principle of least astonishment:
		<OL>
			<LI>There is no "SQL Page/Results Page" duality. Now they're simply
				two panes on the same page.
			<LI>SQL Exceptions from typed in SQL commands no longer show up as
				Message Dialogs. Now they're shown on the bottom as an
				unintrusive message instead of the results.
			<LI>Fixed a weird bug where the text area was showing double
				scrollbars.
		</OL>

	<LI>Now drop components are full blown tree data elements instead of just
strings. This will allow the receiving Panel to determine how to drop different
data elements.

	<LI>Moved all nodes to their own package. Also added a distinction between
convenience collection nodes and nodes that actually refer to an object in the
target DB connection.

	<LI>Revamped Images... Thanks to Dean's Icons from the Java Lobby.

	<LI>Reimplemented all menu interactions with Actions and action
	interfaces.
</UL>

<H4>0.0.10:</H4>

<UL>
	<LI> Added a context menu to the Browser for SELECT * functionality. This
	  context menu is determined by the right panel instead of the left.
</UL>


<H4>0.0.9:</H4>
<UL>

	<LI>Added primitive Drag-and-Drop to the browser and the SQL editor to save
	  typing.

	<LI> Added automated build system via Ant.

	<LI> Added automatic introspection of classes that are available as
	  ServerTypes.

	<LI> Fixed problem where MySQL could not figure out the table columns because the standard JDBC resultset fields were not being used.

</UL>
