<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">JSQLIDE - A SQL Development environment for Java VMs</H1>

<P>JSQLIDE is an environment you can use to write SQL statements directed to any
JDBC database, obtain their results, and do some basic data management.
JSQLIDE is geared toward ease of use and configuration.</P>

<HR>
<H2>What you get</H2>

<H4>If you're a user:</H4>

<P>You get a SQL console with syntax-highlighting and history list, an environment
browser, and a table generation tool.

<H4>If you're a Java Developer</H4>

<P>You also get a platform you can use to embed your own plug-ins in order to
create new functionality for your specific server or vertical application.
You are asked that by the
terms of the license you submit the changes back into the project to improve
everyone's SQL coding life.

<P>The platform you can develop against includes a database Connection Pool,
a wizard and a container.


<H2>Installing SQLIDE</H2>

<P>If you have a JRE 1.3 or later, you can run JSQLIDE from its single binary
JAR, build it from source, or download the native executable for your
architecture, save it to a file somewhere and run that.

<H3>Building from source</H3>
<P>You will need a good, working copy of Ant, the build tool.
<BR/>Unzip the JSQLIDE distribution, and run Ant from within the directory with the build.xml file.
After the build is succesful, it will drop a jsqlide.jar on the build directory. You can then run java -jar build/jsqlide.jar</P>

<H2>Running sqlide for the first time</H2>

<P>The first time you run SQLIDE you will be prompted to specify the default
database connection, including the JAR files that are used by said connection.
Select the database that resembles the most to your actual db server and edit
the fields as you need them. You can change all the properties that get sent
on the connection, so any JDBC standard connection (but not JDBC-ODBC bridge)
should be available.

<P>Afterwards, you will be able to connect to the database and start working.
To create new connections or change any of the configuration options, use the
Tools-Configure menu.</P>

<P>

<HR>

<H3>Your SQLIDE Settings (or, What does this program do to my machine, Exactly?)</H3>

<P>You can find your SQLIDE settings in your <B>$HOME</B> (Unix) or
<B>%USERPROFILE%</B> (Windows) directory, under a hidden directory called
<B>".sqlide"</B> (notice the initial dot). This is multi-user friendly, so
each user has their own settings. To make SQLIDE forget it's been installed
(so it recreates your profile), you can simply remove this directory
when SQLIDE is not running.
Make sure you make a backup of your database definitions just in case.

<P>The files inside this directory are listed along with their purpose as
follows:

<P>

<TABLE BORDER=1>
	<TH>File Name</TH>
	<TH>Purpose</TH>
	<TR>
		<TD>sqlIDE.properties</TD>
		<TD>Main properties file. UI stuff, default directories and such.</TD>
	</TR>
	<TR>
		<TD>*.db.xml</TD>

		<TD>A database definition file. These are XML files that describe how
to connect to SQLIDE. The default.db.xml file is the db definition for the
default database (the one it prompts you to create when you start the program
for the first time). All .db.xml files you put in this directory will appear as
connections under "My Environment".  </TD>

	</TR>
</TABLE>

<P><B>Note:</B> If for some reason you download a new version and it breaks on
startup, try deleting the contents of this directory. Sometimes I screw up. :-)
