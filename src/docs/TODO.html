<UL>

	<LI>The BasicNodeContextOperations class has an option that allows the
	user to add a custom query to the context menu. This has not been
	implemented yet.

	<LI>The configuration should have an option to set a default save
	directory. This directory should default to $HOME/sqlide (no initial dot!),
	and it should be used as initial directory on all Open/Save dialogs.

	<LI>Create a User Manager panel to manage GRANTs

	<LI>Improve Drag and drop:

	<UL>
		<LI>It should be possible to drop at the current cursor location in the Interactive SQL

		<LI>Column components dropped into the table editor should add that
			  column definition to the editor window.
	</UL>

	<LI>Add Index/Primary Key tab to table editor. Add drag-drop from indices
		  to table editor window

	<LI>Finish Implementing the Panel Registry. It needs to keep Panel Polite
Names, class names, a new static action class (see below)... Maybe an XML
implementation of the registry is in order?

	<LI>Start working on DB-specific functionality - add a user manager for
MySQL and come up with a standard set of ResultSets for retrieving users and
analyzing permissions, as well as standard wrappers for GRANTs.

	<LI>The new action interface is working well, but I need a clean way of
getting static actions for all thes different panels. Maybe the Panelregistry
could have an actionclass for each panel? It's late.. This probably will make
no sense in the morning. Anyway, the user feature would be static things like
"Edit this table" to <b>create</b> a new table editor with the table loaded,
etc.

<H2>IDEAS</H2>

<H3> New Panel - The DataMover</H3>

The datamover is a large plugin which has the purpose of giving some basic
functionality for moving data from one database to another.

The goals of the data mover are:

<UL>
	<LI> Server independence: You should be able to move data from MySQL to Oracle
	  to Postgres with a minimum of effort.

	<LI> Dynamic execution: You should be able to execute the script at any time
	  after being defined. Script definitions will reside in XML files.

	<LI> Script Generation: The plugin should be able to generate SQL scripts by
	  reading the source and creating a .sql file for the destination.

	<LI> Destination context change: It should be straightforward to move script
	  definitions to new destination contexts.

The following options will apply to each script:
	<LI> DropFirst - This option will drop the table before trying to create it
	  again
	<LI> CreateDB - This option will try to create the database if it does not
	  exist.
	<LI> SourceCTX - This is a reference to the DatabaseProcess+Catalog+Schema to
	  move data FROM.
	<LI> DestCTX - This is a reference to the DatabaseProcess+Catalog+Schema to
	  move data TO.

	<P>A series of optional CREATETABLE nodes will be optionally specified from
the destination context. This will allow the SQL coder to create tables
following a spec. This is optional; the plugin should be able to create tables
modeling the result set of the data it is copying.

	The instructions will be a series of DATAMOVE xml nodes. They will be
stated as follows:

	<LI> SelectStmt - The SELECT statement that should be executed to get the
	  original ResultSet.

	<H4>Options (attributes):</H4>

	<LI> DestTable  - The destination table that the data should be INSERTED to.
	Options (attributes):
		<UL>
		<LI> droptable [YES/no] Drop the table before starting
		<LI> cleartable [YES/no] Clear all the rows in the table before starting.
		</UL>

</UL>


<H3>Data Mover To-Do</H3>

<LI> Data Mover Data Model: Create a Data Model that can do the following:
	1: Interpret the script via SAX into execution nodes.
	2: Regenerate all the nodes in the script on demand.
	3: Implement ListModel so it can also be represented on the list.

<LI> Data Mover execution: Create an observable that can take an array of
  execution nodes and run them using the connectionPools on the SQLIDE.
