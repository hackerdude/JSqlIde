		<P>This program is licensed under the GNU GPL. You can read the license

		"License" button on the SQLIDE About Box.</P>

		<P>Basically, it's a free license with absolutely no warranty.</P>

		<H2><A NAME="Tutorial">Tutorial</A></H2>

		<P>This tutorial will walk you through doing some database access
		using SQLIDE.</P>

		<P>Start SQLIDE. If you have never set up a server profile, you 
		will be prompted to create a new one.</P>

		<H3>Creating a new Server Profile</H3>

		<P>Create a new server profile. You will need to download a driver for
		the database server you are using. If you only want to test, you can
		download a good, if limited, embedded SQL database at <A
				HREF="http://www.hsqldb.org">http://www.hsqldb.org</A>.</P>

		<P>This tutorial will show you how you can create the server profile
		for HSQLDB. The tutorial uses this database for most sections except
		where more advanced features are needed, in which case we will use <A
				HREF="http://www.postgresql.org">PostgreSQL</A>. SQLIDE works
		with most JDBC drivers.</P>

		<P>After you download the drivers from the web, you will have one (or
		more) JAR files that you need to add to this connection's CLASSPATH.  A
		Class path is a java concept that allows you to load libraries
		dynamically (in this case, the database access libraries).

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="newserverprofile.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>Now that you have the drivers, press "Next". You will then see a
		dialog box prompting you the name of your connection and the server
		type. Select the server type from the list first, and this will
		typically set sensible defaults.

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="newserverprofile2.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P Class="Note">Note: If your server type has no equivalent on
		the list, you can consult the documentation of your JDBC driver
		to still get a succesful connection.</P>

		<P>Always consult the documentation for your JDBC driver so you can set
		better values than the recommended, in particular for the driver class
		name and the URL. The URL suggested is typically meant as a help so you
		can set your own values. For example, in our case, the URL
		jdbc:hsqldb:/home/dmartinez/MyDBFile refers to the fact that the
		embedded Hypersonic database file will be created in your home
		directory.</P>

		<P>Once you make the changes you need for this page, you will be
		asked to set other connection parameters on the next page. These are
		only necessary if your JDBC connection requires it, so we will just 
		click on "I'm Done!".

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="newserverprofile3.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>We are done creating our connection. Next you will see the main 
		Window of SQL-IDE, which is always the first window you see now that 
		you have at least one connection set up (to create more connections or
		change the configuration of the existing connection, select 
		"Tools-&gt;Configure").</P>

		<H3>SQLIDE Guided Tour</H3>

		<P>So now we are in the main window.

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="mainwindow.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>Double-click on "My Environment". You will see a list of your
		connections. Double-clicking on a connection connects you (you will se
		a login dialog) and opens the browser to see the metadata (the list of
		catalogs, tables and stored procedures).</P>

		<P>Like this you can browse the information on the entire database, and
		you can see the details of the selected item in the browser at the
		bottom Information panel.</P>

		<H3>Using the Interactive SQL</H3>

		<P>So now that we've been browsing for a little bit, let's try
		executing some statements against this database. On the menu, select
		"Plug-In-&gt;Interactive SQL", which will bring up an interactive
		window to execute queries against this database connection directly. On
		the editor side, you will se the interactive SQL window.

		<P>With the interactive SQL Window you can execute queries by simply
		tyuping in the statement and pressing the "Go" button or Ctrl-Enter.
		You will see the result set on a table below your query, and a log
		section at the bottom of the editor.</P>

		<P>Now let's try something interesting. Using the editor, select a
		numeric ID field in a table you have on your connection and right-click
		on it. You will now see a list of useful queries that are related to
		this column. Select a query from the list and it will be automatically
		typed into the interactive SQL:

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="interactivesql.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>Now press Control-Enter. You will see the results of the data in the
		bottom.

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="interactivesqlresultset.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>Now, if your database supports it (Postgres and Oracle do,
		Hypersonic doesn't), you can request for the query to be updatable.
		Enable updatable and execute the query again. If your database supports
		it, you will get a message in the log saying "Updatable Resultset
		obtained". You will also get buttons for insert, delete, commit and
		rollback.

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="updatableresultset.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P Class="Note">Note: In order to get an updatable resultset in oracle,
		you need to get the Oracle ROWID, which does not come in when importing
		the tables with an asterisk unless you qualify the tabnle with an
		alias. The Oracle RowID can be obtained easily by formatting your query
		like "SELECT U.* FROM MYTABLE U"</P>

		<P>You can navigate up and down the history list of queries you have
		entered by using Control-Up and Control-Down.</P>

		<P>Something other you can do is this: If you typically type in a query
		that is very complex, you can save it for posterity and give it a name,
		and it will appear on the context menu for this connection for whenever
		you right-click on any of the elements within that connection. For
		example, below you can see that we have created an interesting Join
		that shows songs and the bands that play them. We right-click on the
		selected item on the browser and select "Add this query to
		[MyConnection]". You will be prompted for a name. I entered "My Songs
		Join" so I remember it.

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="addquery.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>So for now on, whenever I right-click on the browser inside this
		connection I have this query as an option:

		<BR/><CENTER><IMG SRC="userquery.png"/></CENTER></P>

		<P>Those are the basics of using SQLIDE. There are other editors
		in addition to the Interactive SQL, such as a table editor.</P>

		<H2><A NAME="SQL">SQL Reference</A></H2>

		<P>SQL stands for "Structured Query Language". It is a language that
		most relational databases support in their own way. This section 
		explains common useful commands you can use.</P>

		<P>SQL Commands sometimes return one (or more) set of results in
		tabular format, and sometimes don't return anything. The commands
		themselves are case-insensitive, but the case sensitivity of the object
		names (in the database) depends on the server you use.</P>

		<H4>Conventions</H4>

		<P>When specifying a syntax, the following conventions are used:</P>

		<UL>
			<LI>{} - Non-literal entry, non-optional</LI>
			<LI>[] - Optional section</LI>
			<LI>.. - Continuation of a pattern</LI>
		</UL>

		<H4>SELECT</H4>

		<P>Basic Syntax: 
		<CODE>SELECT {FIELDSPEC} FROM {TABLENAME} [, TABLENAME..]} [WHERE {EXPRESSION}] [ORDER BY {EXPRESSION}</CODE>
		</P>

		<P>This is the basic command used to return tabular-formatted
		information from a tablespace. Some databases treat the details a
		little differently, but in general you select a series of fields
		(asterisk means all fields) or expressions from a table (or series of
		tables, if you are specifying a "join"). You can specify a sort order
		with ORDER BY, and limit the amount of records that are returned with
		the WHERE clause.</P>

		<P>Examples:

		<BR/><CODE>SELECT * FROM ADDRESSBOOK WHERE LASTNAME = 'Smith'</CODE>
		<BR/><CODE>SELECT * FROM ADDRESSBOOK ORDER BY LASTNAME, FIRSTNAME</CODE>
		<BR/><CODE>SELECT * FROM ADDRESSBOOK WHERE LASTNAME LIKE 'M%' ORDER BY CITY, LASTNAME</CODE>
		</P>

		<H4>UPDATE</H4>

		<P>Basic Syntax: 
		<CODE>UPDATE {TABLENAME} SET {FIELD} = {EXPRESSION} [WHERE {EXPRESSION}]</CODE>
		</P>

		<P>This is a command that modifies existing data. Although the WHERE is
		optional, it is recommended you always use it, since an UPDATE without
		a where clause will modify all the rows in the table. The command is
		pretty straightforward and allows you to make individual and bulk
		updates.</P>

		<P>Examples:

		<BR/><CODE>UPDATE ADDRESSBOOK SET STATE = 'CA' WHERE CITY = 'Los Angeles'</CODE>
		<BR/><CODE>UPDATE ADDRESSBOOK SET FIRSTNAME = 'Elvis', LASTNAME = 'Presley' WHERE ALIAS = 'The King'</CODE>
		</P>

		<H4>DELETE</H4>

		<P>Basic Syntax: 
		<CODE>DELETE FROM {TABLENAME} [WHERE {EXPRESSION}]</CODE>
		</P>

		<P>This command deletes information from the specified table. As in
		update, the WHERE clause is optional but you should always use it
		(ommiting a WHERE clause on a DELETE removes all the data in the
		table).</P>

		<P>Examples:
		<BR/><CODE>DELETE FROM ADDRESSBOOK WHERE COMMENTS = 'Annoying Dude'</CODE>
		</P>

		<H4>INSERT</H4>

		<P>Basic Syntax: 
		<CODE>INSERT INTO {TABLENAME} [ ( {FIELDS} ) ] VALUES ( {VALUES} )</CODE>
		<BR/><CODE>INSERT INTO {TABLENAME} [ ( {FIELDS} ) ] SELECT ..</CODE>
		</P>

		<P>This command inserts new records into the specified table. If you
		don't specify a list of fields, you need to specify all the values in
		the order the database has been designed. If you do specify a set of
		fields, there has to be the same amount of fields than values.</P>

		<P>If you combine the INSERT with a SELECT statement, you can insert
		several rows at a time.

		<P>Examples:
		<BR/><CODE>INSERT INTO PERSON_TYPE VALUES ( 1, 'Cool Person' )</CODE>
		<BR/><CODE>INSERT INTO ADDRESSBOOK ( PERSONID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME ) VALUES ( 1, 'Elvis', 'Presley' )</CODE>
		<BR/><CODE>INSERT INTO ADDRESSBOOK ( PERSONID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME ) VALUES ( SELECT PERSONID, FIRSTNAME, LASTNAME FROM ADDRESSBOOK_BACKUP WHERE LASTNAME LIKE 'M%' ) </CODE>
		</P>

		<P>This is just a few of the basic data manipulation commands you can
		use. See your database user guide for a complete explanation of the
		language and instructions specific to your database.</P>
